# PyBer_Analysis (Matplotlib project)

## Overview of the project

In this project, we were working with `Ride sharing` data-set using jupyter notebook, pandas and python's two dimensional 
plotting library, matplotlib. Pandas is being used for data manipulation and analysis whereas, matplotlib is used to
visualize the data. These visaulizations can be helpful in presenting complex findings in an informative and engaging way.

### Purpose

The main purpose of the project was to analyze the `Ride sharing` data-set to improve the access of ride sharing services
and determine the affordability for under-served neighborhoods. In this project, we have created a data frame of the
ride sharing data by city type and created a multiple line graph to visualize the trend in total weekly fare for
each city type. This can be helpful for the Pyber management to make informed decisions on how to add more
ridership to the application by making right adjustments to the ride-fares.

## Results

- **Total number of rides' comparison:**

While comparing the total number of rides between each city type, we have noticed that the total number of rides in the rural cities is about 8% and 20% of to that in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

- **Total number of drivers' comparison:**
While comparing the `total number of drivers` between each city type, we have noticed that the `total number of drivers` in the rural cities is about 3% and 15% of to that in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

- **Total ride fare comparison:**

While comparing the `total ride fare` between each city type, we have noticed that the `total ride fare` in the rural cities is about 10% and 22% of to that in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

- **Average ride fare comparison:**
While comparing the `average ride fare` between each city type, we have noticed that the `average ride fare` in the rural cities is the highest whereas the average fare per ride fall on second and third places in suburban and urban cities, respectively.

- **Average fare per driver comparison:**
While comparing the `average fare per driver` between each city type, we have noticed that the `average fare per driver` in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times higher than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
